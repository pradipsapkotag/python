Hotel Management System:

1.  The desk officer should be able to add new customers and their personal as well as booking information. One customer can book many rooms and there can
    be many types of rooms (Single, Double, Deluxe, etc). The booking details should include the check-in and check-out date as well as cost and payment
    information.
2.  Each room must have its specific price and payment should be calculated accordingly. There can be many rooms in a hotel and the room status should be tracked.
    For example, whether a room is available or not.
3.  Users should be able to calculate the price of the stay. For example, if a customer wants to stay for 5 days in a single room that costs Rs 2000 per day. 
    The total cost of Rs 10000 should be returned.
